# ATM-Object-Oriented-Design
A simple ATM demonstrating Object Oriented Design with Python by Minh

This simple ATM can check your account balances, deposit and withdraw cash. 

I used 3 classes in order to construct this program. 
- Menu: The GUI
- Account: This class store the user ID and their cash balances
- User: This class is used for storing password and ID

Known issue: 
- The button is purely visual (You can press anywhere and it still works fine)
- The GUI can look better
- Currently no way for the ATM to have more known users.
